- This script will only work on a desktop or laptop. Phones and tablets are not supported.
- Make sure that direction on touch is on when using this script.
- The bots are not stable as of yet, so they are prone to stopping randomly. To start the bots again, you must completely close the browser and reopen.

3. Enjoy static bots for free in Snay.io


# Features of the UserScript:

2. Press 1, 2, c and v to select the first 4 of your emotes (That is if you have emotes)
3. 2 bots that you can start and stop pretty much when ever you want (the bots are static and can not be controlled other than their name and whether they are actively respawning or not).
